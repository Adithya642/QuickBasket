# Quick-Basket

Motivation
The Quick Basket application was created to provide a simple and efficient way for users to find and order groceries online from local stores. With the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic, many people have been hesitant to visit physical stores and instead prefer to shop online. However, existing grocery delivery services can be 
expensive and often have long wait times. Quick Basket aims to address these issues by connecting users with nearby stores that offer online ordering and fast delivery
options. Our hope is that this application will make it easier and more affordable for people to get the groceries they need, while supporting local businesses at the
same time.

                                                                    # QUICK BASKET WEB APPLICATION
Quick Basket is a web application designed to help users find items they need in their area based on their zip code. It enables users to quickly search for items that
they want to purchase from stores near them. The application searches for stores based on the user's zip code, and then displays the available items along with the 
store information. Users can then view detailed information about each store, including its address, phone number, and opening hours.
The application is built using the Spring Boot framework, which makes it easy to create web applications using the Java programming language. The application also
uses MySQL as its database to store and manage data.
Main features of application:
•	Search for items based on zip code
•	View nearby stores
•	View item availability
•	Order online 
•	Review stores and items.
These features make Quick Basket a useful and convenient web application for users who want to find items they need in their area quickly, order them online,
save time by making payment ahead of time, and share their experiences with other users.
